Retrostyle
==========

One of the first games I ever made. Man this code is horrible! I think I started working on it in 2007, worked on it until around 2011 and then lost the code for a while. And now here it is again! Thank goodness for backups. I hope you enjoy this little snippet of my past experiences.

WARNING!
--------

For those who are about to venture forth, be wary that this code (if you could even call it code) was forged by an entirely unexperienced youth known as my former self. Having no understanding of the forces he was dealing with, he haphazardly regurgetated what little knowledge he had accumulated during the few years he had spent in this world. Unbeknownst of him, in his ignorant bliss he summoned ten thousand code smells from the depths of programmer's hell. Thus began my journey into the realm of gamedev.

Video!
------

Go check out a video of it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEqQ9VmhoQ0).
Unfortunately the code has been through some weird transformations over the years so the video doesn't quite match the gameplay. I'll try clean it up and return it to its former awesomeness whenever I find time.

How to build it?
----------------

First, make sure [this](https://github.com/nguillaumin/slick2d-maven) is installed in your local Maven repo. Then just build and run this project any way you normally build and run a Maven project. Personally I think opening it in Netbeans is easiest.
